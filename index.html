        <div class="description">

            <span class="boosted"> Love, Fear and Everything In Between</span> was born at a period when I
            was honestly filled with a
            lot of fear
            concerning… everything. I feel like I’m in the midst of so much change and this change has been happening
            over and over again. I never really had someone to hold my hand and guide me along this path and I’ve made
            so many mistakes. <span class="boosted"> “In spite of fear”, a piece within the collection, was made
                as a constant reminder to myself to chase my dreams and to always belong to love, even amid fear.</span>
            <br><br>

            Making and planning this work got me thinking about a lot. A lot is happening on the planet right now, both
            good and bad. I feel like it’s imperative that <span class="boosted"> we make the best out of
                everything</span>, take nothing at all for granted and remain intentional in everything. From our
            relationships to our utterances to our actions to the
            lives we lead. <br><br>

            <span class="boosted"> Love, Fear and Everything In Between </span> is in place as a reminder to always make
            love with equilibrium, embrace the chance of the pivot, relinquish control, belong [even more] to love,
            dwell where the flow resides, run back to you are at your core, and do it all <span class="boosted"> in
                spite of fear. </span>
