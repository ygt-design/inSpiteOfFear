            I created this piece during a period of deep reflection on my experiences as a perpetual third wheel in
            various relationships throughout my life. While I don't necessarily view being friends with a couple as
            negative, I've often pondered whether there could exist a healthy balance within a trio, where two are
            romantically involved and one remains single.
            <br><br>
            This piece represents a somewhat selfish endeavour in which I deliberately place the spotlight on the third
            wheel. It may seem self-centred or even unconventional, but <span class="boosted">there's a profound sense
                of validation in
                being
                acknowledged, understood, and centred, even if only for a fleeting moment. </span>
            <br><br>
            It's an exploration of the dynamics of friendship and the intricate balance of inclusion and individuality
            within social circles. Ultimately, it underscores the importance of recognizing and honouring the unique
            perspectives and experiences of all parties involved, regardless of their relational status.
