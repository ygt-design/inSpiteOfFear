            Why does everything have to be a game? Why do I not have to double text someone in order to not come off as
            “crazy”? Why do people get so uncomfortable with people expressing love? Why do I have to interact with
            people that aren’t even nice to me in order to “make it out of the hood”? Why do people start to only
            respect you when they feel like you have something to offer them? Why are people so scared of commitment?
            Why do some people lack spatial awareness? Why do hurt people hurt people? Why did you yuck my yum? <span
