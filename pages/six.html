            This shoot I did was a fun creative collaboration with Stephen J Mensah, an individual that I realized I
            share a lot in common with, like our initials (SJ). <span class="boosted"> I found that to be something very
                interesting. That
                wholesome interaction made me think of how much of a phenomenon it is to meet random people who end up
                taking a huge part of your heart, and you taking a huge part of theirs. </span> Compatibility in any
            kind of
            relationship is a huge feat in a world of 7 billion plus people, like the majesty and beauty of good
            friendship, meaningful relationships, and being seen and loved fully, as well as being given the opportunity
            to do the same! Makes one see how connection really is a gift from God.
